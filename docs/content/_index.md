## @h3/reveal Roadmap:

The goal of @h3/reveal moving forward is to make it easier to use for non-developers and
developers alike by modernizing how reveal is distributed, deployed, extended, and integrated.

Our most important goals are currently tracked in our [projects][] and [milestones][]. In particular the [v2 milestone][]
looks to pull as many existing PR's from the upstream project as possible, and bring the reveal project up to speed
with modern tooling, api design, and front-end features.

If you have an existing Pull Request open at [hakimel/reveal.js][upstream] and would like to review the status of
our review of your PR, check out the [Review Upstream Pull Requests][upstream reviews] board. Our process for reviewing
pull requests from [hakimel/reveal.js][upstream] is documented in our `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
